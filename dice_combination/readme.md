The provided code implements a recursive approach to compute elements of a sequence, with each element being the sum of the previous six elements. The algorithm utilizes memoization to optimize recursive calls and employs modular arithmetic to handle large values efficiently.

Psuedo code 
1. Define a global array dp[] initialized with -1 to store computed values.
2. Define a global constant m representing the modulo value.
3. Define a recursive function f(n) that takes an integer n as input:
    a. If n < 0, return 0.
    b. If n == 0, return 1.
    c. If dp[n] != -1, return dp[n].
    d. Compute p = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) + f(n - 3) + f(n - 4) + f(n - 5) + f(n - 6).
    e. Store p % m in dp[n].
    f. Return p.
4. In the main function:
    a. Initialize t = 1.
    b. While t > 0:
        i. Set dp[0] = 1.
        ii. Read an integer n from input.
        iii. Compute and print f(n) % m.



The algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to memoization, making it an efficient solution for computing sequence elements modulo a large value.
