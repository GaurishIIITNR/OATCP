## Intuition and Approach:

The Hamming distance between two integers is the count of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. To find the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the given array, we follow these steps:

1. **Intuition**: We need to compare the bits at each position for every pair of integers and count the number of differences. The Hamming distance between pairs of integers is the product of the count of set bits and the count of unset bits at each bit position.

2. **Approach**:
   - We iterate through each bit position from 0 to 31 (since integers are typically represented using 32 bits).
   - For each bit position, we count the number of integers in the array that have the bit set (1) and the number of integers that have the bit unset (0).
   - The Hamming distance between pairs of integers at the current bit position is the product of the counts of set and unset bits.
   - We sum up these Hamming distances for all bit positions to get the total Hamming distance between all pairs of integers in the array.

By following this approach, we efficiently compute the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the array.

## Code Explanation:

1. The `f` function takes a vector of integers `v` as input and returns the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the array.
2. It initializes `res` to store the result.
3. It iterates through each bit position from 0 to 31.
4. Within the outer loop, it iterates through each integer in the array and counts the number of set bits at the current bit position.
5. It calculates the number of unset bits at the current bit position by subtracting the count of set bits from the total size of the array.
6. The Hamming distance between pairs of integers at the current bit position is the product of the counts of set and unset bits.
7. It adds this Hamming distance to the result `res`.
8. Finally, it returns the total sum of Hamming distances.

The `main` function takes input for the size of the array `n` and the array elements, calls the `f` function, and prints the result.
