## Intuition and Approach

- This problem can be solved using dynamic programming to avoid re-calculating the same subproblems repeatedly.
- We will create a 2D DP array to store the number of paths from each cell to the destination.
- At each cell, we check if it's a trap or not. If it's a trap, the number of paths from that cell to the destination is 0.
- If it's not a trap, we calculate the number of paths by adding the number of paths from the cell to its right and the number of paths from the cell below it.
- We start from the upper-left cell and recursively explore all possible paths until we reach the destination.
- We apply modulo (10^9+7) to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

## Code Explanation

- We define a global 2D DP array `dp` to store the number of paths from each cell.
- We initialize all cells of `dp` to -1 to mark them as not calculated yet.
- We define a recursive function `f()` that takes the grid `v`, current row index `i`, and current column index `j` as arguments.
- In the `f()` function:
  - If we're out of bounds or if the current cell is a trap, we return 0.
  - If we're at the destination cell, we return 1.
  - If the number of paths from the current cell has already been calculated, we return it from the `dp` array.
  - Otherwise, we recursively calculate the number of paths by exploring the cells to the right and below the current cell and store the result in `dp[i][j]`.
- In the `main()` function:
  - We read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
  - We call the `f()` function with the grid, starting from the upper-left cell `(0, 0)`.
  - Finally, we print the result modulo (10^9+7).
