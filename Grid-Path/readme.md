The provided algorithm offers an efficient solution to compute the number of viable paths within a grid from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, accommodating obstacles denoted by '*' characters. Employing a dynamic programming approach with memoization, the algorithm significantly enhances computational efficiency by storing previously computed results. This allows for expedited retrieval of intermediate path counts, thus mitigating redundant calculations. By leveraging a recursive strategy, the algorithm systematically explores grid cells, considering valid movements to the right and downwards while respecting grid boundaries and obstacle placements. Such a methodological approach ensures both accuracy and scalability in handling large grid sizes. Through rigorous modular arithmetic techniques, the algorithm ensures numerical stability by maintaining computed path counts within acceptable bounds. Overall, this algorithm stands as a robust solution suitable for a diverse array of grid-based traversal problems, offering a balance between computational complexity and performance optimization.
